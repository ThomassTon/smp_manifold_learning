# smp_manifold_learning
This is the code that was used for the experiments in the paper 'Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds'. It has been tested and run using Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 16.04.

The datasets that were used in the paper can be found in the directory 'smp_manifold_learning/data/trajectories/'.

The root folder of this project needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH in order to run the scripts.

The implementation of ECoMaNN can be found in 'smp_manifold_learning/differentiable_models/ecmnn.py'.

The script that was used for the ablation study in the paper is 'smp_manifold_learning/scripts/run_ablation_test_ecmnn.bash'.

All code relevant to the scientific contributions of this work are in 'smp_manifold_learning/'.

The VAE models can be generated by running './vae_trials.py' and entering 'y' for each of the prompts.

To see some VAE results and plots from Experiment 1, run './vae_analysis.py'.
